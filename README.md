## Get started with Machine Learning

Datascience is made up of 3 modules 
* 1)Artificial Intelligence 
* 2)Machine Learning
* 3)Deep Learning . 

AI being the bigger umbrella incorporates everything that a machine (i.e. computers) do to mimic human like behavior.
Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence .Machine Learning becoming a buzz word in the IT industry, it's almost impossible to think of a industry that doesnt need intelligent solutions by adapting to Machine Learning paradigm. 
Here I put forward my own experience , the direction in which I preferred learning the subject in a way to make it more easy and convenient  for anyone who is interested in knowing "How Machines Learn ?? "

1) Lets get started with standard  Wikipedia definition of Machine learning, ML is a *field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed*. 
To get understanding of how Machines Learn and how Machine Learning paradigm is different from regular programming paradigm , I would recommend the audience to go through the below references . 

	*  [A Friendly Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpGxLWOIZy4): Introductory video helping you understand Machine Learning
	* [Machine Learning Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seG9J49bBYI): A video that gets you introduced with ML terminologies and concise appropriate definitions 
	* [What is Machine Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXHM_i-fgGo): This video introduces you to prominent different ways in which we can make Machines learn , viz. Supervised Learning, UnSupervised Learning , Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive Learning)
	* [Basic Machine Learning Algorithms Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggIk08PNcBo): This video gives insights to different algorithms used for different use cases in Machine Learning
	* [Machine Learning from Zero to Hero](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/machine-learning-how-to-go-from-zero-to-hero-40e26f8aa6da): This video is quite interesting in gaining interest in the subject of Machine Learning.
